# Toy_task

For Model : "train_models/checkpoint.pth"

For visualization i have modified the main.py such that now after evaluation it draw the bounding boxes on the image and store them under the "visual" folder.

After training the pre-trained-model on the training data and then evaluation the AP and AR values are detroiated.
Reasons can be :
--> Overfitting.
--> Insufficient Data for Fine-Tuning.
--> Less data for evaluation.
